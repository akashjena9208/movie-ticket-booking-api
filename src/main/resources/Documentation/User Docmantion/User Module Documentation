All About User in Your Application

In your Movie Booking application, the User represents a person who can register, update their details, or delete their account.

1️⃣ What is a User?

A User is an entity with these main attributes:

id → unique identifier in the database

name → user’s full name

email → user’s email (must be unique)

password → login password (stored securely, usually hashed)

phone → user’s phone number

deleted → boolean flag to indicate if the user is soft-deleted

deletedAt → timestamp of when the user was soft-deleted

Why important:

Users are the main people who book movies.

Each user must have a unique email for login and identification.

2️⃣ What can you do with a User?

Your system supports three main operations on a User:

a) Register a new user

What it does: Adds a new user to the system

How: User sends their details (name, email, password, phone)

Rules:

Email must be unique

All required fields must be valid

Example:

Akash registers with email akash@gmail.com → a new user account is created

b) Update user details

What it does: Change user info like name, phone, or email

How: User sends new data along with their current email

Rules:

If changing email, the new email must not already exist

User must exist in the database

Example:

Akash wants to change his email to newakash@gmail.com → system checks uniqueness → updates details

c) Soft delete a user

What it does: Marks the user account as deleted without removing data

How: User sends a request with their email to delete account

Rules:

User must exist

System sets deleted = true and records deletion time

Example:

Akash wants to delete his account → account is marked as deleted, but data remains in database

3️⃣ Special checks in the system

Unique email check: No two users can have the same email

Soft delete check: Users are not fully removed → allows data recovery

Validation: Input fields are checked for correctness before saving

4️⃣ APIs related to User
Operation	HTTP Method	URL	Purpose
Register User	POST	/register	Add new user
Edit User	PUT	/users/{email}	Update user details
Soft Delete User	DELETE	/users/{email}	Soft delete a user account

Responses are always standardized with status, message, and data.

5️⃣ In Plain English

The User is someone who can use your Movie Booking app.
You can add a new user, update their info, or delete them safely.
The system ensures emails are unique and users’ data is never lost by accident.

If you want, I can also make a super short cheat-sheet of “User in one page” that you can memorize and tell anyone in 1 minute.

Do you want me to do that?

## 2. User Service Methods

### a) `addUser(UserRegistrationRequest user)`

- **Purpose:** Register a new user in the system.
- **Checks:**
  - Email must be unique
  - Validates all required fields using `@Valid`

**Exceptions:**
- `UserExistByEmailException` → if email already exists

---

### b) `editUser(UserUpdationRequest userRequest, String email)`

- **Purpose:** Edit existing user details. Email can also be updated.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check if user exists by current email
  2. If changing email, check that the new email is not already used
  3. Update user details
- **Exceptions:**
  - `UserNotFoundByEmailException` → if user with current email does not exist
  - `UserExistByEmailException` → if new email is already taken

**Important Check in Code:**

```java
if (!user.getEmail().equals(userRequest.email()) && userRepository.existsByEmail(userRequest.email())) {
    throw new UserExistByEmailException("User with the email already exists");
}


Checks:

Are you changing the email?

Is the new email already taken?
→ If both true → throw error

c) softDeleteUser(String email)

Purpose: Soft delete a user (mark as deleted without removing data)

Steps:

Check if user exists by email

Set deleted = true

Set deletedAt = current timestamp

Save changes

Exceptions:

UserNotFoundByEmailException → if user does not exist

Hard delete → completely removes user from database (not used here)

Response Structure: All responses are wrapped in a standard format:

{
  "status": "success | error",
  "message": "string",
  "data": {}
}


Service Layer: Business logic is handled in UserService → keeps controller clean.

Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and uses RestResponseBuilder to send standardized responses.

5. Summary

Users can register, update their info, and soft delete their account.

Email is always unique.

Soft delete allows data recovery.

All operations provide consistent JSON responses for frontend usage.

Exceptions are thrown for not found or duplicate email scenarios.
