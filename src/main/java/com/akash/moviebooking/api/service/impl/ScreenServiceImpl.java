    /*üîé What your code does
                            addScreen
                            Checks if theaterId exists.
                            Loads Theater from DB.
                            Calls copy() ‚Üí builds a Screen + attaches seats.
                            Maps the result to ScreenResponse.

                            copy()
                            Sets screen type, capacity, rows.
                            Validates noOfRows <= capacity.
                            Associates the screen with the theater.
                            Saves the screen (so it now has an ID in DB).
                            Calls createSeats() to make seats.
                            Attaches created seats to the screen object.
                            Returns the screen.
                            createSeats()
                            Calculates how many seats per row:
                            int noOfSeatsPerRow = screen.getCapacity() / screen.getNoOfRows();
                            Example: capacity = 12, rows = 3 ‚Üí 4 seats per row.
                            Creates seats in a loop:
                            Names them row by row (A1, A2, A3, A4 ...).
                            Saves each seat immediately in the DB using seatRepository.save(seat).
                            Keeps them in a local list.
                            When a row fills, moves to the next row (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C).
                            Returns the full seat list.
                            ‚úÖ What is correct
                            Validation (rows > capacity throws exception).
                            Seat naming convention (A1, A2 ‚Ä¶ B1, B2 ‚Ä¶).
                            Linking Seat ‚Üî Screen.
                            Logic produces correct seat arrangement when capacity divides evenly by rows.
                            Mapping response with ScreenMapper.
                            ‚ö†Ô∏è What problems remain
                            N+1 Saves Problem (Performance)
                            seatRepository.save(seat) inside a loop = 1 DB call per seat.
                            300 seats ‚Üí 300 inserts ‚Üí slow.
                            Best practice: attach seats to screen and do one save on screen (with cascade = ALL).
                            Seats are not re-saved with screen
                            You screenRepository.save(screen) before creating seats.
                            Then you attach seats after.
                            Unless you explicitly save again (screenRepository.save(screen)), the JPA cascade will not persist those seats automatically.
                            That‚Äôs why you had to call seatRepository.save(seat) for each one.
                            Uneven Capacity Distribution
                            If capacity % noOfRows != 0, the last row may have fewer seats than others.
                            Example: capacity = 10, rows = 3 ‚Üí
                            A1 A2 A3
                            B1 B2 A4  (naming may become strange depending on loop counters)
                            C1 C2 C3
